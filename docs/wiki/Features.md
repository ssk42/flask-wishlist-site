# Features

## Dashboard
The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of:
- Recent wishes added by family members.
- Upcoming events (birthdays, holidays).
- Quick access to your own wishlist.

## Wishlist Management
- **Add Items:** Easily add new items with details like name, price, link, and priority.
- **Edit/Delete:** Update item details or remove them from your list.
- **Priorities:** Mark items as Low, Medium, High, or Urgent priority.

## Smart Filtering
Filter items by:
- **Person:** View a specific family member's list.
- **Status:** See available, claimed, or purchased items.
- **Event:** Filter items associated with specific events.

## Surprise Protection
This key feature ensures that you never see the "Claimed" or "Purchased" status on your own wishlist items. This keeps gifts a surprise until you receive them.

## Dark Mode
The application supports a dark mode for better visibility in low-light environments. The theme preference is saved in your local browser storage.
